# An Anthology of Challenges

Would be a reasonable title if there were more than 1 single, measly challenge in here.

These challenges are solved in Rust, and can be run locally (on pretty much [any environment](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) with a shell) with:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin <bin_name>
```

where `<bin_name>` is the name of a binary within this project. Valid values are:

- `fizzbuzz`: Discord's "r/ProgrammerHumer" Weekly Challege, from July 1st, 2023
- `primes`: Just a quick tangent, trying to find 40 million primes as efficiently as possible

You can also probably paste into the [Rust Playground](play.rust-lang.org), with minor edits for any solutions spanning multiple files.
