# Challenge - 010723

I went into this thinking "I'll make a cute array of function pointers/closures and check them all"

Then I had conflicting objectives with wanting to cache prime numbers to avoid recomputing (which is probably insignificant with small numbers), so I added a ton of complexity I wouldn't have otherwise needed.

Running this without the `--release` flag also prints the line number at the end of every line
